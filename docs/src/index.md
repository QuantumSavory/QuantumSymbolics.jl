# QuantumSymbolics.jl

```@meta
DocTestSetup = quote
    using QuantumSymbolics
end
```

A symbolics package for quantum information science. It serves two purposes:

- It provides for algebraic manipulation of mathematical expressions related to your quantum models. Particularly helpful when having to automatically generate or simplify expressions of significant complexity.
- An assortment of "expression translators" are provided that can turn a symbolic expression into a numerical one in a variety of formalisms.

Below we list some commonly used expressions, followed by an autogenerated API list.

When a Clifford representation is used, an efficient sampler is generated, and stabilizer states are randomly sampled from the correct distribution:
```@example symb
express(MixedState(X1)/2+SProjector(Z1)/2, CliffordRepr())

!!! warning "Stabilizer state expressions"

    The state written as $\frac{|Z₁⟩⊗|Z₁⟩+|Z₂⟩⊗|Z₂⟩}{√2}$ is a well known stabilizer state, namely a Bell state. However, automatically expressing it as a stabilizer is a prohibitively expensive computational operation in general. We do not perform that computation automatically. If you want to ensure that states you define can be automatically converted to tableaux for Clifford simulations, avoid using summation of kets. On the other hand, in all of our Clifford Monte-Carlo simulations, `⊗` is fully supported, as well as [`projector`](@ref), [`MixedState`](@ref), [`StabilizerState`](@ref), and summation of density matrices.

## Backends

`QuantumSymbolics.jl` supports multiple numerical backends via the `express` API. In addition to structured representations like `QuantumOpticsRepr` and `CliffordRepr`, the new `StateVectorRepr` backend converts symbolic objects to basic linear algebra objects:

```julia
julia> express(X1, StateVectorRepr())
2-element Vector{ComplexF64}:
 0.7071067811865475 + 0.0im
 0.7071067811865475 + 0.0im

julia> express(Z1, StateVectorRepr())
2×2 Matrix{ComplexF64}:
 1.0+0.0im   0.0+0.0im
 0.0+0.0im  -1.0+0.0im
