For physicist usually the excited state is the \"up\" states (erangle=uparrowrangle), but that historical choice clashes with the logical state notation as we have the logical zero be the \"excited\" state. This clash becomes particularly confusing when noise processes and relaxation process are taken into account. E.g. one might think the operator usually denoted hatsigma_- would be the one corresponding to decay but we actually have hatsigma_-0rangle=1rangle. To avoid this confusion we strive to not use the notation uparrowrangle, downarrowrangle, erangle, and grangle. Similarly we strongly prefer to never use hatsigma_- and hatsigma_+, rather only use 1rangle langle0 and its conjugate. If we were instead talking about single-rail photonic qubits, we do not have the same issue (because the diagonal of the number operator is growing, instead of decreasing like the diagonal of the Pauli Z).","category":"page"},{"location":"qubit_basis/","page":"Qubit Basis Choice","title":"Qubit Basis Choice","text":"The basis states can be easily expressed both as kets and as tableaux (In the tableau representation below the top half corresponds to the destabilizer, while the bottom is the stabilizer):","category":"page"},{"location":"qubit_basis/","page":"Qubit Basis Choice","title":"Qubit Basis Choice","text":"julia> express(L0, CliffordRepr())\nRank 1 stabilizer\n+ X\n═══\n+ Z\n═══\n\n\njulia> express(L1, CliffordRepr())\nRank 1 stabilizer\n+ X\n═══\n- Z\n═══\n\n\njulia> express(L₀, CliffordRepr())\nRank 1 stabilizer\n+ X\n═══\n+ Z\n═══\n\n\njulia> express(L₁, CliffordRepr())\nRank 1 stabilizer\n+ X\n═══\n- Z\n═══\n\n\njulia> express(L₊, CliffordRepr())\nRank 1 stabilizer\n+ Z\n═══\n+ X\n═══\n\n\njulia> express(L₋, CliffordRepr())\nRank 1 stabilizer\n+ Z\n═══\n- X\n═══\n\n\njulia> express(L₊ᵢ, CliffordRepr())\nRank 1 stabilizer\n+ Z\n═══\n+ Y\n═══\n\n\njulia> express(L₋ᵢ, CliffordRepr())\nRank 1 stabilizer\n+ Z\n═══\n- Y\n═══","category":"page"},{"location":"qubit_basis/","page":"Qubit Basis Choice","title":"Qubit Basis Choice","text":"julia> express(L₀)\nKet(dim=2)\n  basis: Spin(1/2)\n 1.0 + 0.0im\n 0.0 + 0.0im\n\njulia> express(L₁)\nKet(dim=2)\n  basis: Spin(1/2)\n 0.0 + 0.0im\n 1.0 + 0.0im\n\njulia> express(L₊)\nKet(dim=2)\n  basis: Spin(1/2)\n 0.7071067811865475 + 0.0im\n 0.7071067811865475 + 0.0im\n\njulia> express(L₋)\nKet(dim=2)\n  basis: Spin(1/2)\n  0.7071067811865475 + 0.0im\n -0.7071067811865475 + 0.0im\n\njulia> express(L₊ᵢ)\nKet(dim=2)\n  basis: Spin(1/2)\n 0.7071067811865475 + 0.0im\n                0.0 + 0.7071067811865475im\n\njulia> express(L₋ᵢ)\nKet(dim=2)\n  basis: Spin(1/2)\n 0.7071067811865475 + 0.0im\n                0.0 - 0.7071067811865475im","category":"page"},{"location":"bibliography/#Bibliography","page":"Bibliography","title":"Bibliography","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"bibliography/","page":"Bibliography","title":"Bibliography","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"#QuantumSymbolics.jl","page":"QuantumSymbolics.jl","title":"QuantumSymbolics.jl","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"QuantumSymbolics.jl","title":"QuantumSymbolics.jl","text":"DocTestSetup = quote\n    using QuantumSymbolics\nend","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"QuantumSymbolics.jl","title":"QuantumSymbolics.jl","text":"A symbolics package for quantum information science.
